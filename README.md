**One-click dark mode for any website!**

**What it does:**
- Instantly turns any webpage dark with a single click
- Click again to bring it back to normal
- Perfect for reading at night or reducing eye strain

This was my first extension - a simple test to see if I could actually build one! While you can change Chrome's overall appearance to dark mode, this gives you control over individual websites.

Sometimes when you're working hard and stressed, even a lame joke can lighten your mood! It's perfect for those moments when you need a quick break but don't want to leave your screen.

**See all your unread emails from multiple accounts in one place!**

- Mark all emails as read with one click
- No need to open each account separately

**A timer that keeps running even when you close the popup!**

**What it does:**
- Set countdown timers in seconds
- Continues running in the background

**Why I made it:**
When I'm working under pressure with deadlines, I lose track of time. This timer helps me stay focused and reminds me when to take breaks or switch tasks.

**How to use:**
1. Enter time in seconds
2. Click "Start Timer"
3. Close the popup and keep working
